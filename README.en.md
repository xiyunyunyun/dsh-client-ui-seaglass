# dsh-client-ui-seaglass

English | [中文](README.md)

> **Compatibility** — DSH `0.1.5-rc.1` · **Updated** 2026-09-11 · Plugin v1.6.7

Seaglass is a highly customizable glassmorphism theme: it turns many surfaces into frosted-glass panes, and you can use your own images or videos as the backdrop. Switch the theme off and you are back to the stock UI — without changing a single line of DSH source. If you like the theme, feedback and PRs are welcome.

## Features

- **Two modes**: **Mica** restyles the layout into floating glass cards; **Compatibility Mode** keeps the stock layout byte-for-byte and only swaps the material to generic glass
- **Free backdrop**: switch freely between an image or a video background
- **One switch**: off restores the stock UI exactly
- **Per-script font customization** (Chinese/English)

## Installation

### Option 1: npm one-liner (recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-client-ui-seaglass
```

Installs the latest version from npm and registers it as a profile plugin layer (the `dsh.bundle` patch) — works on every platform. Reload the web UI and it is on.

### Option 2: Local folder install (recommended if you want to hack on / modify the theme source)

Clone the repo anywhere, then hand the **local folder** straight to `dsh plugin add` — it links the folder into the profile and registers the layer for you, no manual `cordis.patch.yml` edits. The repo ships its build output, so it works right after installing; no npm release needed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/xiyunyunyun/dsh-client-ui-seaglass.git
npm install
dsh plugin --profile web add "C:\\path\\to\\dsh-client-ui-seaglass"    # your actual clone path (absolute path recommended)
```
